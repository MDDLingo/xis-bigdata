# Emf2EaXMIAdapter
Emf2EaXMIAdapter is a helper project that transforms a UML model compatible with the [Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF)](https://eclipse.org/modeling/emf/) to its corresponding version compatible with [Sparx Systems Enterprise Architect (EA)](http://www.sparxsystems.com.au/products/ea);

## Usage
To run the Emf2EaXMIAdapter you need to run the Emf2EaXMIAdapter.java class and provide 2 arguments:
  1. The path of the EMF-compatible UML model (e.g. "C:\test.uml");
  2. The path of the generated EA-compatible UML model (e.g. "C:\test.xmi"). This file should always have the .xmi extension.
